# Portfolio Website

This is a simple portfolio website project created by Jakub Wojtczak.  
It showcases my work and skills in a clean and fairly minimal design. 
_It was somewhat vagly inspired by [bemine](https://webflow.com/templates/html/bemine-website-template) website template_

## Features

- Responsive layout
- Fairly easy to customize
- Subject to improvment :)
- Built with Svelte and JavaScript
